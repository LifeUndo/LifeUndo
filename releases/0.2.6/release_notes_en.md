# LifeUndo v0.2.6 — VIP from popup + fixes

## What's New

• **Working RU/EN toggles** — language changes and persists between sessions
• **"What's New" modal closes** (button/ESC/backdrop click)
• **Proper CTAs**: Activate VIP & Upgrade to Pro with clear feedback
• **Trial hidden on VIP**, clutter removed
• **Stable build** with POSIX paths for AMO

## How to Use
