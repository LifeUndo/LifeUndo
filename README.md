# GetLifeUndo — local "Ctrl+Z for life" (Firefox)

GetLifeUndo captures recent text you type, clipboard snippets, quick on-demand screenshots, and recently closed tabs — **locally, private by default**.

- **Text snapshots**: inputs/textarea/contenteditable (passwords & file inputs ignored).
- **Clipboard history**: captured on user copy.
- **Recently closed**: tabs/windows with safe fallbacks.
- **Quick Snap**: on-demand screenshot (button + hotkey).
- **No cloud by default**: all local; screenshots only by explicit action.

## Install
- **Firefox (AMO)**: coming from our AMO listing.
- Version line: **0.3.7.32** (MV2, `gecko.id=lifeundo@example.com`).

## Why privacy-first?
Everything is processed locally. No hidden background screenshots. No passwords or `C:\fakepath` are stored.

## Roadmap (short)
- **Desktop 1.0 (MVP)**: system-wide text snapshots & cross-app clipboard (Win/Mac).
- Extension 0.3.x: stabilization, i18n.
- Website: RU/EN, creators program, honest assistant (email).
